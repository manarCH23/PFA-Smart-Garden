# PFA-Smart-Garden
My end of year project Smart Garden
In this project we aim to learn how to interface different Sensors with stm32 development board,
collect the sensors 's data and send them via UART to an ESP32,
wich will be connected via WIFI to the graphic interface that s made with pyQt6.
The project is divided on 3 parts:
  *stm32-Sensors
  *stm32-Esp32-Connection
  *pyQt6-Interface
